## Microsoft Contributor License Agreement

Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

## Setting up Environment

Follow the instruction bellow to read about compute requirements and install required libraries.


#### Compute environment

We recommend using a virtual machine to run the example notebooks and scripts. The easiest way to get started is to use the [Azure Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) for Linux (Ubuntu)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro). This VM will come installed with all the system requirements that are needed to create the conda environment described below and then run the notebooks in this repository. 

#### Conda environment

To install the package contained in this repository, navigate to the directory where you pulled the Forecasting repo to run:
```bash
conda update conda
conda env create -f tools/environment.yaml
```
This will create the appropriate conda environment to run experiments. Next activate the installed environment:
```bash
conda activate forecast
```

During development, in case you need to update the environment due to a conda env file change, you can run
```
conda env update --file tools/environment.yaml
```
from the root of Forecasting repo.

#### Package installation

Next you will need to install the common package for forecasting:
```bash
pip install -e forecasting_lib
```

The library is installed in developer mode with the `-e` flag. This means that all changes made to the library locally, are immediately available.

## Getting Started with Examples

### Dataset

This repository provides examples on how to run various forecasting algorithms on a publicly available `orangeJuice` dataset. This dataset containes weekly sales of refrigerated orange juice at 83 stores, as well as, demographic information on those stores. The data is provided via [`bayesm`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bayesm) package in `R`, and further described in [Chapter 5, Bayesian Statistics and Marketing by Rossi, Allenby, and McCulloch](http://www.perossi.org/home/bsm-1). `Forecasting_lib` package provides utilies for downloading and processing this data. 

### Run Examples

#### Notebooks
We provide example notebooks under `examples/` to demonstrate how to train and evaluate forecasting algorithms.

Make sure to run the notebooks in the conda environment we previously set up (`forecast`). To register the conda environment in Jupyter, please run:

```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name forecast
```

## Steps to Contributing

Here are the basic steps to get started with your first contribution. Please reach out with any questions.
1. Use [open issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/Forecasting/issues) to discuss the proposed changes. Create an issue describing changes if necessary to collect feedback. Also, please use provided labels to tag issues so everyone can easily sort issues of interest.
2. [Fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) so you can make and test local changes.
3. Create a new branch for the issue. We suggest prefixing the branch with your username and then a descriptive title, e.g. chenhui/python_test_pipeline.
5. Make code changes.
6. Ensure unit tests pass and code style / formatting is consistent (see [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recommenders/wiki/Coding-Guidelines#python-and-docstrings-style) for more details).
7. We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) package to run our pre-commit hooks. We use [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) formatter and [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) for linting on each commit. In order to set up pre-commit on your machine, follow the steps here, please note that you only need to run these steps the first time you use `pre-commit` for this project.
   
    * Update your conda environment, `pre-commit` is part of the yaml file or just do
        ```
        $ pip install pre-commit
        ```    
    * Set up `pre-commit` by running following command, this will put pre-commit under your .git/hooks directory. 
        ```
        $ pre-commit install
        ```
        > Note: Git hooks to install are specified in the pre-commit configuration file `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Settings used by `black` and `flake8` are specified in `pyproject.toml` and `.flake8` files, respectively.
    * When you've made changes on local files and are ready to commit, run
        ```
        $ git commit -m "message" 
        ```
    * Each time you commit, git will run the pre-commit hooks on any python files that are getting committed and are part of the git index. If `black` modifies/formats the file, or if `flake8` finds any linting errors, the commit will not succeed. You will need to stage the file again if `black` changed the file, or fix the issues identified by `flake8` and and stage it again.

    * To run pre-commit on all files just run
        ```
        $ pre-commit run --all-files
        ```
    
    
8. Create a pull request (PR) against __`staging`__ branch.


We use `staging` branch to land all new features, so please remember to create the Pull Request against `staging`. To work with GitHub, please see the next section for more detail about our [working with GitHub](#working-with-github).

Once the features included in a milestone are complete we will merge `staging` into `master` branch and make a release. See the wiki for more detail about our [merge strategy](https://github.com/Microsoft/Forecasting/wiki/Strategy-to-merge-the-code-to-master-branch).

### Working with GitHub

1. All development is done in a branch off from the `staging` and named following this convention: `<user>/<topic>`.
To create a new branch, run this command:
    ```shell
    $ git checkout -b <user>/<topic>
    ```

    When done making the changes locally, push your branch to the server, but make sure to sync with the remote first. 

    ```
    $ git pull origin staging
    $ git push origin <your branch>
    ```

2. To merge a new branch into the `staging` branch, please open a pull request. 

3. The person who opens a PR should complete the PR, once it has been reviewed and all comments addressed.

4. We will use *Squash and Merge* when completing PRs, to maintain a clean merge history on the repo.

5. When a branch is merged into the `staging`, it must be deleted from the remote repository.

    ```shell
    # Delete local branch
    $ git branch -d <your branch>

    # Delete remote branch
    $ git push origin --delete <your branch>
    ```


## Coding Guidelines

We strive to maintain high quality code to make it easy to understand, use, and extend. We also work hard to maintain a friendly and constructive environment. We've found that having clear expectations on the development process and consistent style helps to ensure everyone can contribute and collaborate effectively.

Please review the [coding guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recommenders/wiki/Coding-Guidelines) wiki page to see more details about the expectations for development approach and style.


## Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

Apart from the official Code of Conduct developed by Microsoft, in the Forecasting team we adopt the following behaviors, to ensure a great working environment:

#### Do not point fingers
Letâ€™s be constructive.

<summary><em>Click here to see some examples</em></summary>

"This method is missing docstrings" instead of "YOU forgot to put docstrings".

</details>

#### Provide code feedback based on evidence 

When making code reviews, try to support your ideas based on evidence (papers, library documentation, stackoverflow, etc) rather than your personal preferences. 

<details>

"When reviewing this code, I saw that the Python implementation the metrics are based on classes, however, [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics) and [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/metrics) use functions. We should follow the standard in the industry."

#### Ask questions do not give answers
Try to be empathic.
