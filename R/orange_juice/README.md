## Orange juice dataset

You'll need the following packages to run the notebooks in this directory:

- bayesm (the source of the data)
- dplyr
- tidyr
- jsonlite
- tsibble
- fable
- fabletools
- feasts

The easiest way to install them is to run

```r
install.packages("bayesm")
install.packages("tidyverse") # installs all tidyverse packages
install.packages("fable")     # installs other tidyverts packages as dependencies
install.packages("feasts")
```
